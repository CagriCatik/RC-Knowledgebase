# Brushless Motor Numbers Explained

Brushless motors are the workhorses of modern RC models, drones, and various precision devices, offering unmatched efficiency and reliability compared to brushed alternatives. Despite their ubiquity, understanding the numbers and specifications printed on these motors can be challenging, particularly for those new to the field. This tutorial provides an in-depth explanation of brushless motor specifications, focusing on their precise meanings and implications for performance.

## **1. The Fundamentals of Brushless Motors**

Brushless motors operate using electronic commutation instead of mechanical brushes. This design eliminates wear-and-tear associated with brushes, making them highly durable. The wear points in these motors are primarily the bearings, which can be replaced as needed.

Key Characteristics:
- **Three-phase Design**: Brushless motors use three-phase AC power for operation. 
- **Direction Control**: Switching any two of the three motor wires reverses the direction of rotation.
- **Motor Types**:
  - **Outrunner Motors**: The outer can rotates with the shaft. These are commonly used in drones and RC planes due to their higher torque-to-weight ratio.
  - **Inrunner Motors**: The rotor inside the stationary can rotates. These motors are often used in RC cars and helicopters, where compact size and higher rotational speeds (RPM) are advantageous.

## **2. Brushless Motor Numbering System**

A typical motor, such as "2822 1450 KV," encodes key specifications in its label. These numbers provide insights into the motor’s physical dimensions, performance, and electrical characteristics.

### **2.1. Rotor Diameter (First Two Digits)**
- Example: "28" indicates a rotor or can diameter of 28 mm.
- **Impact on Performance**:
  - Larger diameters produce higher torque due to increased leverage at the rotor's edge.
  - Diameter directly correlates with the motor’s ability to handle larger propellers.

### **2.2. Motor Length (Second Two Digits)**
- Example: "22" signifies a motor length of 22 mm.
- **Significance**:
  - Longer motors can house more windings, enhancing torque and magnetic field strength.
  - Compact motors with smaller lengths prioritize weight savings and higher RPMs.

### **2.3. KV Rating (RPM per Volt)**
- Example: "1450 KV" indicates the motor spins at 1450 RPM per volt under no-load conditions.
- **Key Considerations**:
  - **High KV** motors are designed for higher speeds but generate less torque.
  - **Low KV** motors prioritize torque, enabling them to turn larger propellers efficiently.
- **Performance Example**: At 10V, a 1450 KV motor spins \( 1450 \times 10 = 14,500 \) RPM under ideal (no-load) conditions.

### **2.4. Winding Turns**
- Lower winding counts result in higher RPMs but reduced torque.
- Higher winding counts increase torque but reduce speed.

## **3. Key Performance Metrics**

Brushless motor performance is quantified by several key metrics. Understanding these is essential for selecting the right motor for your application.

### **3.1. Power (Watts)**
- Formula: \( P = V \times I \)  
  \( V \): Voltage supplied  
  \( I \): Current drawn  
- Higher power motors (e.g., >250W) are suitable for larger drones or RC models requiring significant thrust.

### **3.2. Current (Amps)**
- The current a motor draws determines the ESC (Electronic Speed Controller) rating required.
- **Rule of Thumb**:
  - ESC current rating \( \geq \) 120% of the motor’s peak current draw.
  - For a motor drawing 22A, use an ESC rated for at least 26A.

### **3.3. Thrust**
- Measured in grams or kilograms, thrust represents the force generated by the motor-propeller combination.
- **Application-Specific Needs**:
  - **RC Planes**: Thrust equal to the model's weight allows stable flight; 1.5–2x thrust enables aerobatic maneuvers.
  - **Quadcopters**: Total thrust from all motors should exceed the model's weight by a factor of 2 for adequate performance and stability.

### **3.4. Weight**
- A motor's weight impacts the overall performance of the model.
- Always account for additional components, such as prop adapters, when calculating the motor’s contribution to the total weight.

### **3.5. Voltage**
- Brushless motors are rated for specific voltage ranges, typically corresponding to LiPo battery configurations:
  - **1S**: 3.7V
  - **2S**: 7.4V
  - **3S**: 11.1V
  - **4S**: 14.8V
- Higher voltage configurations allow smaller propellers to maintain efficiency and reduce current draw.

## **4. Matching Motors to Applications**

Proper motor selection is critical to ensure optimal performance and prevent damage. Follow these guidelines to make informed decisions.

### **4.1. Application Requirements**
- Define the use case: Fixed-wing plane, quadcopter, or ground vehicle.
- Consider the weight, thrust, and required flight dynamics.

### **4.2. Propeller Compatibility**
- Use the manufacturer’s recommended propeller size and pitch for the motor.
- Avoid oversized propellers, as they exponentially increase the motor load and current draw, risking overheating or failure.

### **4.3. ESC Matching**
- Ensure the ESC is rated for both the motor's peak current and voltage range.
- Underrated ESCs can fail due to excessive electrical stress.

## **5. Practical Example: Analyzing a 2822 1450 KV Motor**

### **Specifications**:
- **Rotor Diameter**: 28 mm
- **Motor Length**: 22 mm
- **KV Rating**: 1450 KV
- **Peak Current**: 22A (requires ESC rated for ≥26A)

### **Performance Analysis**:
- At 11.1V (3S LiPo), the motor achieves \( 1450 \times 11.1 = 16,095 \) RPM under no load.
- Combined with a recommended propeller, it generates sufficient thrust for a mid-weight RC plane or quadcopter.

## **6. Common Pitfalls and Misconceptions**

1. **Underrated ESCs**:
   - Using an ESC rated below the motor’s peak current draw risks damage. Always allow a safety margin of at least 20%.

2. **Over-propping**:
   - Larger or higher-pitch propellers increase load disproportionately, leading to motor and ESC overheating.

3. **Thrust-to-Weight Ratio**:
   - For quadcopters, ensure the combined thrust of all motors is at least double the total weight to maintain stability and maneuverability.

## **7. Conclusion**

Understanding brushless motor specifications is a cornerstone of designing efficient and reliable RC models. By mastering the concepts of rotor dimensions, KV ratings, winding turns, and performance metrics, you can select and optimize motors for diverse applications. Precision in matching motors with ESCs, propellers, and power sources ensures peak performance and longevity, allowing you to push the limits of your designs with confidence.
