# FEATURE REQUEST FORM

## (a.k.a. Your Dreams, Our Problem)

So you want *more* from this project? That’s cute. Use this form to request a new feature, enhancement, or arcane capability the software obviously should’ve had from day one.

## BEFORE YOU BEGIN

- Check existing issues. Your “brilliant idea” might already exist.
- Be realistic. No, it won’t make coffee.
- If it requires AI to read your mind, don’t bother.

## REQUIRED INFO

**1. What do you want?**  
Describe the feature as if we’re five years old but sarcastic. Be specific.

> _“Add dark mode”_ = fine  
> _“Make it automatically generate perfect code based on vibes”_ = no

**2. Why do you want it?**  
Explain your suffering. Show us the pain of living without this feature. Bonus points if you use memes, ASCII art, or interpretive bug logs.

**3. How should it work?**  
Rough sketches, API ideas, UI mockups, or angry rants welcome. Don’t say “just like X app” without linking it.

**4. Alternatives you considered**  
Let us know if you tried duct tape, sed scripts, or hiring a wizard.

**5. Anything else**  
Feel free to beg. It’s entertaining.

## AFTER SUBMISSION

Your request will be:

- Laughed at, then possibly considered
- Marked as “someday maybe” and forgotten
- Implemented instantly by a bored maintainer (unlikely)
- Turned into a bug by accident

Thank you for dreaming big in a mediocre codebase.
