# BUG REPORT FORM  

## (a.k.a. Tattle Here When It All Goes Wrong)

Thank you for breaking the project. Really. Without people like you, we’d never know how badly this code sucks in the real world.

Before you waste everyone’s time, make sure this is actually a bug and not:

- Your fault
- Your system’s fault
- A cosmic ray
- A hallucination

## REQUIRED INFO (YES, WE MEAN IT)

**1. Describe the bug**  
Tell us what broke. Be clear. Be brutally honest.

> _“It crashed when I clicked the thing”_ is not useful.  
> _“Explodes when you pass `null` to `initialize_rocket()`”_ is.

**2. Steps to reproduce**  
Make it fail for us. Baby steps.

1. Do this  
2. Then this  
3. Watch it die

**3. Expected behavior**  
What did you _think_ would happen? Rainbows? Glory? A functioning feature?

**4. Actual behavior**  
What _actually_ happened? Paste the error, the logs, the fire.

**5. Screenshots or logs**  
Visual evidence is key. Paste logs or screenshots unless you enjoy vague bug purgatory.

**6. Environment**

- OS: [e.g. Windows, MacOS, Arch BTW]
- Version: [e.g. 0.0.1-beta-trash]
- Node/Python/Whatever: [yes, even the broken version]

## OPTIONAL BUT NICE

- What you tried before submitting (besides prayer)
- Anything you regret

## CLOSING STATEMENT

By submitting this, you accept that your bug may be:

- Ignored
- Ridiculed
- Instantly fixed (rare)
- Assigned to someone else (always)

Thanks for your bravery.
