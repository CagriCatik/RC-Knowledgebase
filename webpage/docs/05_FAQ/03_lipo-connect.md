## 1. Introduction

LiPo batteries are widely used in remote control (RC) applications, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and other portable electronic systems due to their high energy density and light weight. In many applications, it becomes necessary to adjust the overall voltage or capacity of the battery pack. This is achieved by connecting individual LiPo cells or complete battery packs either in series or in parallel:
- **Series Connection:** Increases the total voltage while maintaining the same capacity (milliampere-hour, mAh) rating.
- **Parallel Connection:** Increases the overall capacity and current delivery while maintaining the same voltage.

A combined series-parallel configuration is also possible and is sometimes required to meet both voltage and capacity demands.

## 2. Safety Considerations

Before undertaking any LiPo battery assembly, it is imperative to observe strict safety protocols due to the high energy content of these batteries. The following precautions must be adhered to:
- **Uniformity of Cells:** Only connect batteries or cells that are of the same type, capacity, C rating, and nominal voltage. Mismatched batteries can lead to uneven current distribution, potential overcharge or over-discharge of individual cells, and increased risk of thermal runaway.
- **Short-Circuit Prevention:** LiPo batteries are highly susceptible to short circuits. Accidental shorting (e.g., by reversing the polarity of connections) may cause excessive current flow, overheating, and in extreme cases, fire or explosion.
- **Double-Checking Connections:** Prior to finalizing any assembly, verify all connections carefully. Ensure that positive and negative leads are correctly identified and connected according to the intended series or parallel configuration.
- **Handling Precautions:** Avoid physical damage such as puncturing or piercing the battery cells, as this may also lead to dangerous thermal events.

## 3. Series Connections

### 3.1 Principle of Series Connection

In a series configuration, the positive terminal of one battery (or cell) is connected to the negative terminal of the next battery. The total voltage of the pack is the sum of the voltages of the individual batteries, while the overall capacity (mAh) remains equal to that of a single battery.

- **Example:**  
  For a battery composed of cells each having a nominal voltage of 3.7 V (with a typical range from 3.5 V to 4.2 V under load and charge conditions), connecting three cells in series results in a nominal pack voltage of approximately 11.1 V (or up to 12.6 V when fully charged).

### 3.2 Wiring Method for Series Connection

The standard method for creating a series connection is as follows:
1. **Identify Terminals:** Determine the positive and negative terminals of each battery or cell.
2. **Connect Sequentially:**  
   - Connect the negative terminal of the first battery to the common ground of the overall pack.
   - Connect the positive terminal of the first battery to the negative terminal of the second battery.
   - Continue this pattern until all batteries are connected.
3. **Output Terminals:**  
   - The overall negative terminal of the pack is the negative terminal of the first battery.
   - The overall positive terminal is the positive terminal of the last battery in the series.

### 3.3 Characteristics of a Series Pack

- **Voltage Increase:** The pack voltage is the sum of the individual battery voltages. For example, three 3S (three-cell) batteries connected in series will produce a battery pack with the number of cells equal to the sum of each individual battery’s cells (e.g., three 3S packs in series yield a 9S configuration).
- **Capacity Unchanged:** The capacity in mAh remains the same as that of the individual battery, meaning that while voltage increases, the overall energy storage (in terms of current over time) does not.

## 4. Parallel Connections

### 4.1 Principle of Parallel Connection

In a parallel configuration, all the positive terminals of the batteries (or cells) are connected together, and all the negative terminals are likewise connected together. The voltage across the pack remains equal to the voltage of a single battery, while the overall capacity (mAh) and current capability are the sum of the capacities of the individual batteries.

- **Example:**  
  Three 3S 1000 mAh batteries connected in parallel result in a 3S battery pack with a capacity of 3000 mAh.

### 4.2 Wiring Method for Parallel Connection

The following steps outline the process for connecting batteries in parallel:
1. **Connect Negative Terminals:** Join all negative terminals of the batteries together. This common connection forms the negative output of the pack.
2. **Connect Positive Terminals:** Similarly, join all positive terminals together to form the positive output.
3. **Ensure Uniformity:** All batteries must have the same voltage level before connecting; otherwise, current will flow from higher-voltage cells to lower-voltage cells, potentially causing damage or hazardous conditions.

### 4.3 Characteristics of a Parallel Pack

- **Voltage Constant:** The overall voltage remains the same as the voltage of the individual batteries.
- **Capacity Increase:** The total capacity is the sum of the individual battery capacities, which increases the overall energy storage and current delivery capability.
- **Current Sharing:** When discharging, the load current is shared among the batteries, reducing the stress on any single battery.

## 5. Combined Series-Parallel Configurations

### 5.1 Concept and Applications

A combined series-parallel configuration involves connecting groups of batteries in series to achieve the desired voltage and then connecting these series groups in parallel to increase the capacity. This approach is useful when both voltage and capacity must be adjusted to meet specific application requirements.

### 5.2 Example Configuration

- **Scenario:**  
  Consider three 3S 1000 mAh batteries connected in series to form a 9S 1000 mAh pack. If two such series-connected packs are then connected in parallel, the resulting battery pack will have:
  - **Voltage:** The voltage remains that of the series pack (e.g., 36 V if each cell provides approximately 4 V when fully charged).
  - **Capacity:** The capacity doubles (e.g., 2000 mAh), as the capacities of the individual series packs add together.

### 5.3 Notation

Battery configurations are often denoted using the “S” and “P” notation:
- **S (Series):** Indicates the number of cells connected in series (e.g., 3S, 6S).
- **P (Parallel):** Indicates the number of parallel-connected groups (e.g., 3S1P means three cells in series, whereas 3S2P means two groups of three cells in series connected in parallel).

This notation succinctly conveys the overall configuration and is critical for understanding the resulting voltage and capacity.

## 6. Practical Considerations and Guidelines

### 6.1 Consistency and Matching

- **Battery Matching:** Only connect batteries that are identical in chemistry, capacity, and C rating. Mixing different batteries can lead to imbalanced charge/discharge cycles and increased risk of failure.
- **Voltage Equilibrium:** Ensure that all batteries are at the same state-of-charge before connecting them in parallel. Voltage mismatches can cause large current flows that may damage the cells.

### 6.2 Connector Integrity

- **Quality of Connectors:** Use appropriate, high-quality connectors (such as XT60 connectors) and distribution boards designed for high-current applications.
- **Secure Connections:** Ensure that all connections are mechanically secure and electrically sound. Loose connections can lead to intermittent contact, resulting in arcing or overheating.

### 6.3 Charging Considerations

- **Charger Compatibility:** When charging batteries connected in series or parallel, use a balance charger that is designed for the specific configuration. For series-connected packs, the charger must balance each cell individually to avoid overcharging.
- **Parallel Charging:** Charging batteries in parallel requires that all cells are at the same voltage before connecting them. Many commercial balance boards are available to facilitate safe parallel charging.

This documentation has provided a detailed technical overview of connecting LiPo batteries in series, parallel, and combined series-parallel configurations. Key points include:

- **Series Connection:** Increases voltage while keeping the capacity constant. It involves connecting the positive terminal of one battery to the negative terminal of the next.
- **Parallel Connection:** Increases capacity (and current delivery capability) while maintaining the same voltage. It involves connecting all positive terminals together and all negative terminals together.
- **Combined Series-Parallel:** Allows for adjustment of both voltage and capacity by first configuring batteries in series and then connecting these series groups in parallel.
- **Safety Protocols:** Emphasize using matched batteries, verifying all connections, and employing proper charging equipment to prevent hazards such as short circuits and thermal runaway.

Adhering to these guidelines will ensure that LiPo battery packs are assembled safely and perform reliably in high-demand applications. Rigorous testing and verification of all connections and battery parameters are essential before integrating the pack into any system.
