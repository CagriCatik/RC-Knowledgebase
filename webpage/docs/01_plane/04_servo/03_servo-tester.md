2. **Connect Servo:** Plug the servo's connector into the appropriate input on the tester.
3. **Adjust Position:** Turn the control knob to move the servo between 0° and 60°, observing its movement.
4. **Verify Response:** Ensure smooth and accurate movement without any lag or jitter.

### Auto Mode

**Purpose:** Set the servo to its neutral position, essential for calibration during installation.

**Steps:**

1. **Select Auto Mode:** Switch the tester to Auto Mode using the mode switch.
2. **Connect Servo:** Plug in the servo as described above.
3. **Neutral Positioning:** The tester will automatically center the servo, allowing you to mark or adjust the neutral point on your RC model.
4. **Installation:** Once neutralized, install the servo into your RC airplane, ensuring precise control surface alignment.

### Continuous Sweep Mode

**Purpose:** Continuously move the servo left and right, useful for assessing full-range motion and detecting any irregularities.

**Steps:**

1. **Select Sweep Mode:** Activate Continuous Sweep Mode via the mode switch.
2. **Connect Servo:** Insert the servo into the tester.
3. **Observe Movement:** The servo will oscillate between its minimum and maximum positions.
4. **Identify Issues:** Look for any signs of stuttering, uneven movement, or failure to return to the neutral position.
