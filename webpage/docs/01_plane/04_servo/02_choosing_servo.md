# Chossing the Right Servo

Servos are integral components in radio-controlled (RC) airplanes, particularly in precision aerobatic disciplines like F3A (Precision Aerobatics). They are responsible for moving the aircraft's control surfaces—such as ailerons, rudders, and elevators—in response to pilot inputs. Selecting the right servos ensures that your airplane responds accurately and reliably, enabling smooth and precise execution of complex maneuvers. This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to choosing servos for RC planes, with a focus on F3A models, outlining key specifications, reputable brands, and practical considerations to help you make informed decisions.

## Understanding Servos in F3A Models

In F3A (Precision Aerobatics) models, servos are the small electric motors responsible for moving the airplane's control surfaces—such as ailerons, rudders, and elevators—in response to signals from the transmitter. These servos must translate electrical commands into precise mechanical movements with high accuracy, reliability, and responsiveness. Given the competitive nature of F3A, where pilots perform intricate maneuvers within standardized patterns, the performance of servos directly impacts the aircraft's handling and overall performance.

**Key Roles of Servos:**

- **Ailerons:** Control the roll of the airplane.
- **Rudders:** Control the yaw, allowing the airplane to turn left or right.
- **Elevators:** Control the pitch, enabling the airplane to ascend or descend.

## Key Specifications for F3A Servos

When selecting servos for F3A models, several key specifications must be considered to ensure optimal performance:

### Torque

- **Definition:** Torque, measured in kilogram-centimeters (kg·cm), indicates the force a servo can exert to move the control surfaces.
  
- **Recommendations:**
  - **Ailerons and Elevators:** 6–10 kg·cm per servo.
  - **Rudder:** 10–20 kg·cm per servo.
  
- **Considerations:**
  - **Monoplanes vs. Biplanes:** Biplanes typically require higher torque due to the additional control surfaces and aerodynamic complexities.
  - **Performance Level:** Higher torque servos can handle larger control surfaces and provide more precise movements, crucial for advanced aerobatic maneuvers.

### Speed

- **Definition:** Speed, often measured as seconds per degree (e.g., seconds per 60°), indicates how quickly a servo can move from one position to another.
  
- **Recommendations:**
  - **Ailerons and Elevators:** 0.15 seconds per 60° or faster.
  
- **Importance:**
  - **Responsiveness:** Faster servos enhance the airplane's responsiveness to control inputs, allowing for quicker and more accurate maneuver execution.
  - **Precision Aerobatics:** In F3A, where movements are minimal but highly precise, servo speed contributes to the smoothness and accuracy of control surface adjustments.

### Weight

- **Definition:** The weight of the servo affects the overall weight distribution and balance of the airplane.
  
- **Recommendations:**
  - **Ailerons and Elevators:** 20–35 grams per servo.
  - **Rudder:** 45–70 grams per servo.
  
- **Considerations:**
  - **Weight Distribution:** Proper weight distribution is essential for maintaining the airplane's center of gravity, affecting stability and control.
  - **Performance Impact:** Lighter servos reduce the overall weight of the airplane, contributing to better maneuverability and efficiency.

### Dimensions

- **Importance:** Ensuring that the servo fits within the designated compartments of the airplane is critical, especially for control surfaces like wings and elevators.
  
- **Considerations:**
  - **Wing Profile:** The shape and size of the wing profile dictate the available space for servo installation.
  - **Model Compatibility:** Verify that the servo's dimensions are compatible with your specific airplane model to avoid installation issues.

### Voltage

- **Definition:** The operating voltage of a servo affects its performance characteristics.
  
- **Recommendations:**
  - **High Voltage:** Servos operating above 7.4 volts are preferred for enhanced performance.
  
- **Considerations:**
  - **Receiver and Power Supply:** Ensure that your receiver and power supply are compatible with the servo's voltage requirements to prevent damage and ensure optimal performance.

### Gear Material and Build Quality

- **Importance:** The gear material and overall build quality influence the servo's durability and reliability.
  
- **Options:**
  - **Metallic (Titanium) Gears:** Offer higher strength and longevity, suitable for the demanding movements in F3A maneuvers.
  - **Plastic Gears:** Lighter but less durable, generally not recommended for high-stress applications like F3A.
  
- **Considerations:**
  - **Wear and Tear:** High-quality materials resist wear, maintaining consistent performance over time.
  - **Precision:** Robust construction minimizes play and ensures accurate positioning of control surfaces.
