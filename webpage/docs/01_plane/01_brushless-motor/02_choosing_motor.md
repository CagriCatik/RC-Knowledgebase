# Selecting Brushless Motors

---

## 1. Core Principles of Brushless Motor Operation

### 1.1 Torque Generation in Brushless Motors  
Brushless motors convert electrical energy into mechanical torque through electromagnetic interactions:  
- **Rotor**: Contains permanent magnets.  
- **Stator**: Houses copper windings that generate a rotating magnetic field when energized.  

**Torque equation**:  
$$
\tau = F \times r \quad \text{where } F = \frac{B^2 A}{2\mu_0}
$$  
- $B$ = Magnetic flux density (Tesla)  
- $A$ = Interaction area (m²)  
- $r$ = Radius from rotational axis (m)  

**Key Insight**: Stator volume (cross-sectional area × height) directly determines torque potential. High-quality motors use similar materials (N52 magnets, oxygen-free copper), making stator size the primary torque differentiator.

### 1.2 Stator Volume vs. Geometry  
**Myth Debunked**: "Wider motors inherently produce more torque."  
- Two motors with identical stator volumes and materials yield comparable torque, regardless of shape (tall vs. wide).  
- Real-world performance variations stem from manufacturing tolerances, cooling efficiency, or winding techniques—not geometry alone.  

**Critical Metric**:  
$$
\text{Stator Volume} = \pi \times \left(\frac{\text{Diameter}}{2}\right)^2 \times \text{Height}
$$  
- Example: A 2207 motor (22mm diameter, 7mm height) ≈ 847 mm³.

### 1.3 kV Rating Demystified  
**Definition**: RPM per volt under no load.  
- **High kV**: Prioritizes RPM over torque. Ideal for lightweight setups or speed-focused applications.  
- **Low kV**: Favors torque at lower RPM. Essential for heavy props/payloads.  

**Voltage Dependency**:  
$$
\text{Required kV} = \frac{\text{Propeller Coefficient (PC)}}{\text{Battery Cell Count (S)}}
$$  
- Example: 7-inch prop (PC ≈ 7600) on 4S → ~1900 kV.

## 2. Application-Specific Design Guidelines

### 2.1 RC Airplanes: Balancing Torque, Cooling, and Responsiveness  

#### **Key Considerations**  
1. **Reserve Torque for Maneuvers**:  
   - Angular acceleration $\dot{\omega} = \tau_\text{reserve}/I$ dictates responsiveness.  
   - Prioritize motors with 20–30% excess torque over steady-state needs for climbs/loops.  

2. **Geometry Tradeoffs**:  
   - *Tall Motors*: Lower rotational inertia for rapid throttle response; prone to overheating.  
   - *Wide Motors*: Better cooling but higher inertia (rotor inertia ∝ $r^2$).  

3. **Optimal Diameter-to-Height Ratios**:  
   - **3:1**: General sport flying.  
   - **4:1**: Aerobatics/heavy models.  
   - **>6:1**: Avoid unless torque compensates for inertia.  

4. **Propeller Matching**:  
   - Large props (e.g., warbirds) demand high stator volume.  
   - Small trainers suffice with compact motors.  

#### **Throttle Management**  
- Use transmitter throttle curves/expo to mitigate overly sensitive setups.

### 2.2 Drones: Optimizing for Prop Size and Flight Dynamics  

#### **Motor Sizing by Propeller**  
| Prop Size | Min. Stator Volume (mm³) | kV Range (4S) | Example Motors |  
|-----------|---------------------------|---------------|----------------|  
| 5-inch    | 600                       | 2300–2600     | 2205, 2206     |  
| 6-inch    | 700                       | 1900–2200     | 2207, 2306     |  
| 7-inch    | 900                       | 1500–1800     | 2208, 2407     |  

#### **Critical Design Rules**  
1. **7-Inch Prop Requirements**:  
   - Stator volume ≥900 mm³ (e.g., 2208, 2507).  
   - Target 1600–1800 kV on 4S; lower to 1200–1400 kV for 6S.  

2. **Torque vs. Weight Tradeoff**:  
   - Larger stators improve stability but add 10–20g/motor.  
   - Acceptable for most builds; crucial for heavy-lift/cinematic drones.  

3. **Voltage Efficiency**:  
   - 6S systems reduce current draw by ~33% vs. 4S at same power.  
   - Requires ESC/prop compatibility.

## 3. Troubleshooting Common Issues  

### **RC Planes**  
- **Overheating**: Switch to wider motors or add cooling vents.  
- **Sluggish Response**: Reduce prop pitch/diameter or increase stator volume.  

### **Drones**  
- **Bobbing/Oscillations**: Upgrade to higher-torque motors; retune PIDs.  
- **Vibrations**: Balance props; check motor mounts/shafts.

## 4. Advanced Optimization Strategies  

### **Thermal Management**  
- **Airflow**: Wide motors excel here; add heat sinks for tall motors.  
- **ESC Syncing**: Ensure ESC timing matches motor specs to reduce heat.  

### **Performance Tuning**  
- **Thrust Testing**: Use a thrust stand to validate motor-prop pairs.  
- **Telemetry**: Monitor real-time current/voltage to prevent sag.

## 5. Conclusion: Tailoring Your Power System  

1. **RC Planes**: Prioritize stator volume for torque, then optimize geometry for cooling/response.  
2. **Drones**: Match stator volume and kV to prop size; excess torque enhances control.  

**Final Tip**: Bench-test motors with intended props/batteries. Real-world data trumps theoretical specs for refining performance.
