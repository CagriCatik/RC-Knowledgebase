# Introduction

## 1. Overview of ESCs

Electronic Speed Controllers (ESCs) are essential components in radio-controlled (RC) models and various electric vehicles. They perform two primary functions:

- **Motor Control**: Regulate power delivery to electric motors, particularly brushless DC (BLDC) motors.
- **Battery Eliminator Circuit (BEC)**: Supply regulated voltage (commonly +5V) to onboard electronics such as flight controllers and servos.

## 2. How ESCs Work

### 2.1 Three-Phase Brushless Motor Operation

Brushless motors are three-phase devices requiring precise control for efficient operation. The ESC manages this through:

- **Electromagnet Sequencing**: The ESC energizes the motor's stator windings in a specific sequence, creating a rotating magnetic field that interacts with the rotor's permanent magnets, producing motion.
- **Rotor Position Detection**: ESCs often use back electromotive force (back-EMF) sensing to determine the rotor's position, adjusting the timing of phase switching accordingly.

**Key Notes**:

- Swapping any two of the motor's three wires will reverse its rotation direction.
- Some ESC firmware allows motor direction reversal through software configuration.

### 2.2 ESC Wiring

- **Motor Connections**: Three wires connect the ESC to the motor, corresponding to the three phases.
- **Power Input**: Typically consists of red (positive) and black (negative) wires connecting to the battery or power distribution board.
- **Signal/BEC Cable**:
  - Signal wire receives input (e.g., PWM signal) from the flight controller or receiver.
  - BEC output provides regulated voltage to power onboard electronics, if the ESC includes a BEC.

## 3. ESC Settings

ESCs offer various configurable settings to optimize performance for specific applications:

- **Brake**: Applies resistance to stop the motor quickly; often disabled in multirotor applications to allow free-spinning propellers.
- **Soft Start**: Gradually increases motor speed upon startup to prevent mechanical stress, beneficial in applications like helicopters.
- **Motor Direction**: Sets the default rotation direction; can be adjusted by swapping motor wires or through firmware settings.
- **Low Voltage Cutoff**: Reduces or cuts power to the motor when battery voltage drops below a set threshold to protect the battery from over-discharge.
- **Throttle Response Time**: Controls how quickly the motor responds to throttle input changes, affecting acceleration and deceleration.
- **Timing (Advance)**: Adjusts the phase timing relative to the rotor position, influencing efficiency and performance; higher timing can increase power output but may cause more heat.

## 4. ESC Firmware Types

Modern ESCs utilize various firmware to enhance performance and provide customization options:

### 4.1 SimonK

- **Features**:
  - Optimized for rapid throttle response.
  - Preconfigured settings suitable for multirotor applications.
- **Limitations**: Limited customization options; changes often require reflashing the firmware.

### 4.2 BLHeli

- **Features**:
  - Offers similar optimizations as SimonK.
  - Provides extensive configurability via PC software, allowing adjustments to parameters like timing and PWM frequency.
- **Advantages**: Better suited for larger, low-KV motors and allows on-the-fly adjustments without reflashing.

### 4.3 OneShot Protocol

- **Function**: A communication protocol that provides faster signal transmission between the flight controller and ESC, improving response times.
- **Benefit**: Enhances flight performance by reducing latency in motor speed adjustments.
- **Requirement**: Both the flight controller and ESC must support the OneShot protocol.

## 5. Throttle Calibration

Calibrating the ESC ensures it accurately interprets the full range of throttle signals from the transmitter or flight controller:

1. **Enter Calibration Mode**: Power on the ESC in calibration mode; the method varies by firmware and ESC model.
2. **Set Throttle Range**: Move the throttle to its maximum position, then to its minimum position, allowing the ESC to learn the range.
3. **Confirmation**: Listen for confirmation tones or beeps indicating successful calibration.

**Importance**: Proper calibration prevents issues like asynchronous motor startup, where one motor may lag behind others at low throttle settings.

## 6. Battery Eliminator Circuits

BECs are integral to ESCs, providing power to onboard electronics without the need for separate batteries.

| Type       | Description                                                                 | Use Case                          |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Linear** | Reduces voltage through heat dissipation; simpler design.                 | Suitable for setups with â‰¤4S batteries and lower current demands. |
| **Switched** | Uses switching regulators for efficient voltage step-down.             | Ideal for high-voltage setups (5S+); typically used with a single ESC to avoid conflicts. |
| **Opto**   | Lacks an internal BEC; provides optical isolation to prevent electrical noise interference. | Used in high-noise environments; requires an external BEC or power distribution board. |
| **None**   | No BEC functionality; common in high-power ESCs.                         | Necessitates a separate BEC or power distribution solution. |

### 6.2 BEC Best Practices

- **Linear BECs**: Can be used in parallel across multiple ESCs without significant issues.
- **Switched BECs**: It's advisable to disable the BEC on all but one ESC to
