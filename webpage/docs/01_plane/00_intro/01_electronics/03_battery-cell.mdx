# Selecting the Battery Cell Count

Selecting the correct Li‑Po battery configuration is essential for ensuring adequate power while balancing weight, efficiency, and safety.

---

## Importance of Cell Count

* **Nominal voltage scales with cell count**: each Li‑Po cell is nominally 3.7 V (max 4.2 V when fully charged), so a 6S pack yields ≈ 22.2 V ([RC Battery Depot][1], [Wikipedia][2]).
* **Higher voltage reduces current draw** for the same power output, minimizing heat in ESC and wiring, and improving overall efficiency ([ecalc.ch][3], [enerforcebattery.com][4]).
* **Trade‑offs**:

  * **Pros of higher cell counts (e.g. 6S–8S)**:

    * Lower current for required power
    * Less heat and improved system efficiency
    * Potential for higher RPM and thrust at high voltage
  * **Cons**:

    * Greater battery weight and bulk
    * Increased cost
    * Requires motor and ESC rated for higher voltage ([RC Jim][5], [enerforcebattery.com][4], [RC Ratings][6])

## Recommended Cell Count Ranges

RC‑explained data suggests typical configurations by airframe size and type:

| Wingspan (in) | Slower Flight Type | Higher Flight Speed Type |                             |
| ------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| 30–39         | 2S                 | 2S–3S                    |                             |
| 38–56         | 3S                 | 3S                       |                             |
| 50–70         | 4S                 | 4S                       |                             |
| 70–90         | 5S–6S              | 7S–8S                    |                             |
| 90–105        | (not listed)       | 7S–8S                    |                             |
| 105+          | (n/a)              | 9S–10S                   | ([radiocontrolinfo.com][7]) |

For an 82″ wingspan trainer aircraft:

* Slower/trainer flight recommends 5S–6S
* High‑speed or aerobatic: 7S–8S
* More common baseline is **6S (≈22.2 V nominal)** for balanced performance and weight ([radiocontrolinfo.com][7], [enerforcebattery.com][4])

---

## Capacity Considerations

* **Capacity (mAh)** affects flight duration but adds weight ([enerforcebattery.com][4]).
* Typical capacity ranges:

  * Small planes: 2200–3000 mAh for lighter weight and reasonable duration
  * Larger trainers or scale models: 4000–6000 mAh for longer flights, if airframe supports extra weight ([enerforcebattery.com][4])
* Use the formula:

  ```
  FlightTime(min) ≈ (Capacity × 60) / (CurrentDraw × 1000)
  ```

  Adjust for throttle usage and power needs ([Global Batteries][8]).

---

## Example Specification

* **Aircraft**: 82″ wingspan, \~11 lb (≈5 kg) all‑up weight, trainer style
* **Cell count**: 6S (≈22.2 V nominal)
* **Capacity**: 4000–5000 mAh
* **Expected advantages**:

  * Lower current draw relative to lower‑voltage setups
  * Reduced heating and stress on ESC/motor
  * Capable flight duration (≈8–12 min typical for trainer loads) without excessive weight

---

## Safety and Battery Selection Notes

* Never discharge Li‑Po below \~3.0 V/cell; land before cells approach \~3.5–3.7 V to preserve capacity and avoid damage ([goldeneaglesrcclub.com][9], [radiocontrolinfo.com][7], [RC Battery Depot][1]).
* Match battery **C‑rating** to motor/ESC peak amp demand (e.g. 25C‑50C ratings support high‑load flight) ([Global Batteries][8]).
* Ensure ESC and motor are rated for selected cell voltage.
* Assess compartment dimensions and weight constraints before choosing high‑cell‑count and high‑capacity packs ([rcuniverse.com][10], [Hooked on RC Airplanes][11]).

---

* Choose a battery cell count that delivers sufficient voltage without excess weight.
* Use a **6S, 22.2 V pack** for an 82″ trainer to balance performance, efficiency, and safety.
* Use **4000–5000 mAh capacity** to optimize flight duration with moderate added weight.
* Validate power system compatibility and safety margins in all selections.
