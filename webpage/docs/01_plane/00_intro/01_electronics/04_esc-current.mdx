# ESC and Current Selection

Selecting a suitable Electronic Speed Controller (ESC) requires accurate current estimation, proper sizing with safety margin, and compatible battery pairing.

## Estimating Current Draw

Given:

- Required power: **1100 W**  
- Battery: **6‑cell LiPo**, nominal voltage = 6 × 3.7 V = **22.2 V**

Compute continuous current:

```math
I = P / V = 1100 W ÷ 22.2 V ≈ 49.5 A
````

Expected continuous current draw: **≈ 49.5 A**.

### 5.2 ESC Sizing with Safety Margin

Guidance: select an ESC with \~20% headroom above continuous draw to accommodate bursts, thermal rise, and measurement variation ([rslfpv.com][1]).

```math
Iₘᵢₙ = 49.5 A × 1.2 ≈ 59.4 A
```

Recommendations:

* Minimum ESC rating: **60 A continuous**
* Preferred ESC range: **60–80 A** for added robustness
* Consider ESC’s **burst current rating** (typically +10–30%) ([rslfpv.com][1])

## Battery C‑Rating & Capacity

Battery C‑rating defines safe continuous current:

```math
Iₘₐₓ = C × Capacity (Ah)
```

### Example: 4000 mAh (4.0 Ah)

```math
Cₘᵢₙ = 49.5 A ÷ 4.0 Ah = 12.4 C
```

Choose **≥ 25 C** to minimize voltage sag, thermal stress, and extend cycle life ([rctech.net][2]).

### Example: 2200 mAh (2.2 Ah)

```math
Cₘᵢₙ = 49.5 A ÷ 2.2 Ah ≈ 22.5 C
```

* Feasible with **25–35 C** packs
* Downsides: shorter runtime, increased heat, higher IR drop
* Prefer **≥ 4000 mAh** for trainer and sport aircraft ([FliteTest Forum][3])

## Summary Table

| Parameter                       | Value                       |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Continuous current draw         | \~49.5 A                    |
| ESC minimum rating              | \~60 A                      |
| ESC preferred rating            | 60–80 A                     |
| Battery minimum C‑rating @ 4 Ah | ≥ 12.5 C (recommend ≥ 25 C) |
| Battery with 2.2 Ah             | ≥ 22.7 C (use ≥ 25 C)       |

## Additional Factors

* Verify ESC supports the battery voltage range (6S LiPo → 22.2 V nominal) ([rcplanelab.com][4], [Labdarna][5], [Swell RC][6], [rslfpv.com][1], [Wikipedia][7], [FliteTest Forum][8], [RC Ratings][9]).
* Use a watt-meter to measure actual current draw with full-throttle test later, after bare motor, battery, and propeller are installed ([hooked-on-rc-airplanes.com][10]).
* Ensure ESC includes a proper BEC or integrated LVC (Low Voltage Cutoff) to maintain control surfaces at battery near cut-off ([Wikipedia][11]).
* Proper cooling and layout matter; overspec ESC may add weight, while underspec ESC risks damage or mid‑flight shutdown ([Labdarna][5], [rcplanelab.com][4]).
