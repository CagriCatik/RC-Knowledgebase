# Determining Required Power

Sizing an RC aircraft's power system relies on the **power-to-weight ratio**, typically expressed in **watts per kilogram (W/kg)**. This metric defines how much electric power is available per unit mass and directly influences performance, including takeoff thrust, climb rate, aerobatic capability, and overall agility.

## 4.1 Understanding Power-to-Weight Ratio (W/kg)

The ratio is calculated using:

```math
P = M × R
```

Where:

* `P` = Total required power (W)
* `M` = Aircraft ready-to-fly mass (kg)
* `R` = Target power-to-weight ratio (W/kg)

## 4.2 Typical Ranges by Flight Profile

| Power (W/kg) | Flight Type                          | Description                                                     |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 130–185      | Trainer / Glider / Thermal           | Focus on stability and long endurance. Limited aerobatic power. |
| 200–230      | Sport / General Aerobatics           | Good for rolls, loops, mild vertical climbs.                    |
| 300+         | 3D / Aggressive Aerobatics / Pattern | Instant throttle response, hover, vertical climbs.              |

> Rule of thumb: 100 W/lb ≈ 220 W/kg ([FliteTest](https://www.flitetest.com/articles/power-system-basics))

## 4.3 Example Calculation: 5.0 kg Trainer Aircraft

Target profile: **Sport Flight (200 W/kg)**

```math
P = 5.0 kg × 200 W/kg = 1000 W
```

> **Result**: You need at least **1000 watts** continuous power output from the motor-propeller system.

## 4.4 System Component Matching

This 1000 W target informs selection of all drivetrain components:

### 4.4.1 Motor

* Select a **brushless outrunner** rated for:

  * ≥ 1000 W continuous
  * Voltage: 6S (22.2 V) compatible
  * Kv suited to intended propeller diameter and pitch
* Use manufacturer data or eCalc simulation to validate power at expected RPM.

> See: [RCMotorCalc](https://www.ecalc.ch/motorcalc.php) for system simulation.

---

### 4.4.2 ESC (Electronic Speed Controller)

Add a **20–30% safety margin** to handle bursts and thermal load:

```math
I = 1000 W ÷ 22.2 V ≈ 45 A ⇒ ESC ≥ 60 A
```

* **Minimum**: 60 A continuous
* **Preferred**: 70–80 A for overhead
* Must support 6S LiPo voltage range
* Include BEC (if powering receiver/servos) or use external UBEC

---

### 4.4.3 Battery

* Capacity: ≥ 4000 mAh for reasonable flight time
* Discharge Rating (C):

```math
Iₘₐₓ = 4.0 Ah × 35C = 140 A
```

* Result: 140 A > 45 A draw ⇒ **sufficient margin**
* Preferred spec: **6S 4000–5000 mAh 35C**

> Reference: [BatteryUniversity.com](https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-503a-battery-testing-equipment)

---

### 4.4.4 Propeller

* Match to motor Kv and voltage to yield \~1000 W @ full throttle
* Confirm with **wattmeter** (e.g. Turnigy or PowerLog)

> Example: If your motor pulls 45 A @ 22.2 V with a 12×6 APC prop, that’s \~999 W.

### 4.5 Summary

| Component | Specification Needed               |
| --------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Motor     | ≥ 1000 W, 6S capable, matched Kv   |
| ESC       | ≥ 60 A (continuous), 6S compatible |
| Battery   | 6S 4000+ mAh, ≥ 25–35 C            |
| Propeller | Matches motor to achieve 1000 W    |

## 4.6 Conclusion

The **W/kg method** ensures consistent, scalable power calculations across aircraft types. For a 5 kg sport flyer, designing around **1000 W** allows you to meet expected performance targets without overloading the system or underpowering the airframe.

Use real-world measurements (wattmeter, thrust stand) to validate theoretical specs.
