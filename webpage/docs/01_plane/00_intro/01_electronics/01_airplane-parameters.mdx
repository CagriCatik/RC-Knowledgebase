# Defining Airplane Parameters

Accurate specification of critical parameters is essential for selecting components and predicting flight performance in metric units (meters, kilograms, watts). Guidelines below are supported by current industry sources.

## Wingspan (Span)

Wingspan, the distance between wingtips, strongly affects:

* **Wing loading** (kg/m²), influencing stall speed and handling.
* **Aspect ratio**, impacting aerodynamic efficiency.
* Transport considerations.

Typical range:

* **Park‑flyers**: \~0.8–1.0 m
* **Sport/trainer models**: \~1.3–1.9 m
* **Large hobby models**: up to \~2.7–3.0 m

---

## All‑Up Weight (AUW)

**AUW** is the total mass at ready‑to‑fly condition, includes:

* Airframe (foam, balsa, composite)
* Motor + propeller
* Battery (LiPo/Li‑ion)
* Electronics (ESC, receiver, servos)
* Hardware and accessories

Estimate AUW early and iterate: heavier batteries or motors may require revising center-of-gravity or wing loading assumptions.

## Wing Loading

Convert total flying weight (kg) and wing area (m²) to wing loading in kg/m². Use empirical categories:

* **Slow flyers / thermal gliders**: ```< 20 kg/m² (≈ under 4 oz/ft²)```
* **Basic trainers / park flyers**: ```\~25–50 kg/m² (≈5–7 oz/ft²)```
* **Sport / scale aerobatics**: ```\~50–65 kg/m² (≈7–10 oz/ft²)```
* **High‑speed warbirds / racers**: ```> 65 kg/m² (≈≥13 oz/ft²)``` ([Fly RC Magazine][1], [rcuniverse.com][2], [rcplanes.online][3], [Goodies RC][4])

Lower wing loading yields slower stall speed and better handling; higher values improve speed and penetration in wind.

## Power Input per Mass (W/kg)

Input power recommendations depend on flying style ([rcplanes.online][3]):

* **Trainers / slow scale models**: \~155–200 W/kg
* **Sport / fast scale aerobatics**: \~200–245 W/kg
* **Advanced aerobatic / high‑speed models**: \~245–285 W/kg
* **Lightly loaded 3D / ducted fan**: \~285–330 W/kg
* **Unlimited performance 3D**: \~330–440+ W/kg ([wrcs.org.au][5])

MotoCalc and other sources support a rule of thumb: \~88–132 W/kg (\~40–60 W/lb) for typical sport‑class aircraft ([motocalc.com][6]). For beginners, start with the lower end of the range.

---

## Thrust-to-Weight Ratio (T/W)

For stable flight and climb performance, thrust should match a fraction of weight:

* **Trainers**: \~0.5–0.8 :1 (i.e. thrust ≈50–80% of AUW)
* **Fast / aerobatic models**: ≥0.8 :1 or more for responsive performance ([Goodies RC][7], [RC Ratings][8])

Example: a 1.2 kg trainer ideally has \~0.84 kg thrust (0.7:1) to fly comfortably ([Joyplanes][9]).

---

## Valid Parameter Envelope

Design guidelines apply reliably for:

* **Wingspan**: ```\~0.8–3.0 m```
* **AUW**: ```\~0.7–18 kg```

Micro models ```(<0.7 kg)``` and giant‑scale ```(>18 kg)``` need adapted assumptions: micro models face low Reynolds number effects; large models benefit from redundancies and gas power systems. ([www.slideshare.net][10], [Goodies RC][11])

## Design Summary Table

| Class / Flight Style    | Wing Loading (kg/m²) | Input Power (W/kg) | Thrust‑to‑Weight |
| ----------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------- |
| Slow / trainer          | \~25–50              | \~155–200          | \~0.5–0.8:1      |
| Sport / aerobatic scale | \~50–65              | \~200–245          | ≥0.8:1           |
| Advanced aerobatic / 3D | ≥65                  | \~245–330+         | 1.0:1 or higher  |

## Iteration and Validation

1. Specify intended flying style: trainer, sport, aerobatic, 3D.
2. Estimate AUW (include margin).
3. Compute wing area and wing loading.
4. Calculate target input watts (AUW × desired W/kg).
5. Verify thrust rating of motor/prop achieves desired T/W ratio.
6. Iterate component selection to balance AUW, power, and CG.
