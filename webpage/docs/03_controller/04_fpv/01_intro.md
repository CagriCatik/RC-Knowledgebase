# Introduction

FPV (First-Person View) is a technology that allows operators to experience a live, real-time perspective from the viewpoint of a remote-controlled device. By transmitting video footage directly to the operator's display, whether it be goggles, a monitor, or a virtual reality headset, FPV creates an immersive experience that enhances control and situational awareness. While commonly associated with drones, FPV is also extensively used in other remote-controlled (RC) applications such as airplanes, cars, boats, and even wearable devices. The versatility of FPV makes it a popular choice for racing, exploration, aerial photography, and interactive entertainment.

FPV, or **First-Person View**, is a method of controlling radio-controlled (RC) airplanes by viewing a live video feed from an onboard camera. This immersive approach allows pilots to navigate and maneuver their aircraft as if they were seated in the cockpit, providing enhanced situational awareness and control precision. The FPV system for RC airplanes typically includes the following components:

- **Camera**: Mounted on the airplane to capture real-time video from the aircraft's perspective.
- **Video Transmitter (VTX)**: Sends the video feed from the camera to the pilot's receiver.
- **Video Receiver (VRX)**: Receives the transmitted video signal.
- **Display Device**: FPV goggles, monitors, or virtual reality headsets that display the live video feed to the pilot.
- **On-Screen Display (OSD)**: Overlays critical flight data (e.g., speed, altitude, battery voltage) onto the video feed.
- **Pan-and-Tilt Gimbals**: Allow dynamic adjustment of the camera's orientation for better viewing angles.
- **Head-Tracking Systems**: Synchronize the camera's movement with the pilot's head movements, enhancing the immersive experience.

FPV for RC airplanes is widely used in various applications, including:

- **Aerial Photography and Videography**: Capturing stunning visuals from unique perspectives.
- **RC Aerobatics**: Performing complex maneuvers with enhanced control and precision.
- **Long-Range Exploration**: Navigating vast distances and exploring remote areas with real-time feedback.
- **Simulation and Training**: Practicing flight skills in a controlled and immersive environment.
