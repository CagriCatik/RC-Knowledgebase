- **Continuous Current**:
  $$ \text{Continuous Current} = \text{Capacity (Ah)} \times \text{C-Rating} $$
  $$ 4Ah \times 30C = 120A $$

- **Burst Current**:
  $$ \text{Burst Current} = \text{Capacity (Ah)} \times \text{Burst C-Rating} $$
  $$ 4Ah \times 40C = 160A $$

**Note**: Manufacturers often inflate C-ratings under optimal conditions. It's crucial to verify these ratings against real-world performance and usage scenarios.

### 3. Cell Count and Pack Voltage

- **Notation**: Indicated as the number of cells in series (e.g., **3S**, **5S**).
- **Explanation**: Represents the number of individual cells connected in series within the battery pack.
- **Pack Voltage Calculation**:
  $$ \text{Pack Voltage} = \text{Nominal Voltage per Cell} \times \text{Number of Cells} $$
  $$ 3.7V \times 5 = 18.5V $$

**Example**:
A **5S** LiPo pack has:
- **Nominal Voltage**: **18.5 volts**
- **Peak Voltage**: 
  $$ 4.2V \times 5 = 21V $$

### 4. Additional Markings
