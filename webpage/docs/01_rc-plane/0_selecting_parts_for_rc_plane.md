## 2. Defining Airplane Parameters

Understanding the fundamental parameters of your RC airplane is essential before selecting components. These parameters include the wingspan and all-up weight (AUW).

### 2.1 All-Up Weight (AUW)

**All-Up Weight (AUW)** refers to the total mass of the airplane, encompassing:

- **Airframe**: The structural body.
- **Motor and Propeller**: Powerplant components.
- **Battery**: Energy source.
- **Electronics**: Includes ESC, receiver, servos, and other onboard systems.
- **Hardware**: Screws, connectors, and miscellaneous parts.

**Note**: If exact component weights are unknown, iterative calculations are recommended. For instance, selecting a heavier motor or battery may necessitate revisiting subsequent steps to adjust component choices accordingly.

### 2.2 Domain Constraints

The methods and formulas described herein are validated primarily for airplanes within the following ranges:

- **Wingspan**: Approximately 30–115 inches (up to ~120 inches).
- **All-Up Weight (AUW)**: Up to ~30–40 pounds.

These ranges cover many sport and trainer models. However, for aircraft outside this range—such as giant-scale models (50–100 pounds) or micro-sized aircraft (~1–2 pounds)—aerodynamic and motor-efficiency assumptions may differ significantly, necessitating adjustments in watt-per-pound calculations and propeller considerations.

## 3. Determining Required Wattage

A fundamental principle in RC aviation is planning based on **Watts per Pound (W/lb)**, which serves as a measure of flight performance.

### 3.1 Understanding Watts per Pound

**Watts per Pound (W/lb)** is a metric that relates the total power (in watts) required to the weight (in pounds) of the airplane. It influences flight characteristics such as speed, maneuverability, and endurance.

#### Common W/lb Values:

- **60–85 W/lb**: Lightly loaded or basic trainer—emphasizes longer flight times and stability.
- **100 W/lb**: Trainer with more spirited flight or moderate sport flying—balances performance and control.
- **150+ W/lb**: 3D/aerobatic/pattern-level performance—enables advanced maneuvers and aggressive throttle use.

### 3.2 Example Calculation

Consider an 11-pound trainer airplane aiming for moderate sport flying:

$$
\text{Wattage per pound} = 100 \,\text{W/lb}
$$

$$
\text{Total required wattage} 
= 11 \,\text{lb} \times 100 \,\text{W/lb} 
= 1100 \,\text{W}
$$

**Interpretation**: This wattage serves as the baseline for selecting motor size, ESC rating, battery voltage, and propeller load. While actual in-flight wattage may vary, adhering closely to this value ensures consistent and reliable performance.

## 4. Selecting the Battery Cell Count

Choosing the appropriate battery configuration is critical for delivering the necessary power while maintaining efficiency and safety.

### 4.1 Importance of Cell Count

**Battery cell count** directly influences the **nominal voltage** of the battery pack. Higher voltage, achieved by increasing the number of cells (S), allows for the same power output at a lower current, reducing heat and stress on the ESC and wiring.

**Trade-offs**:
- **Advantages of Higher Cell Count (e.g., 6S)**:
  - Lower current for the same power.
  - Reduced heat generation.
  - Potential for better efficiency.

- **Disadvantages**:
  - Increased battery weight.
  - Higher cost.
  - Necessitates ESC and motor compatibility with higher voltages.

### 4.2 Recommended Cell Count Ranges

Based on the aircraft's wingspan and domain constraints:

- **82-Inch Wingspan Example**: **6S** (22.2 V nominal) is recommended.

**Guidelines**:
- **Smaller Wingspans (30–60 inches)**: Typically 4S (14.8 V) to 6S.
- **Larger Wingspans (90–120 inches)**: May benefit from 6S to 8S, considering additional power requirements.

**Note**: These are baseline recommendations. Specific aircraft designs may require deviations based on performance goals and component specifications.

### 4.3 Capacity Considerations

**Battery Capacity (mAh)** affects flight duration and overall weight:

- **Common Ranges**: 2200 mAh to 5000 mAh.
- **Higher Capacity (4000–5000 mAh)**:
  - **Pros**: Longer flight times.
  - **Cons**: Increased weight, potentially higher wing loading.

- **Lower Capacity (2200–3000 mAh)**:
  - **Pros**: Reduced weight, lower cost.
  - **Cons**: Shorter flight durations.

**Selected Approach for Example**:
- **Cell Count**: 6S (22.2 V nominal).
- **Capacity Range**: 4000–5000 mAh.

**Rationale**: Balances flight duration with manageable weight, suitable for an 82-inch wingspan and 11-pound AUW trainer.

## 5. Current and ESC Selection

Selecting an appropriate Electronic Speed Controller (ESC) involves calculating the expected current draw and ensuring sufficient headroom to handle dynamic loads.

### 5.1 Calculating Current

Using the total required wattage and battery voltage:

$$
P = 1100 \,\text{W}
$$

$$
V_{\text{nom}} = 6 \times 3.7 \,\text{V} = 22.2 \,\text{V}
$$

$$
I = \frac{P}{V_{\text{nom}}} = \frac{1100 \,\text{W}}{22.2 \,\text{V}} \approx 49.5 \,\text{A}
$$

**Result**: Approximately **49.5 A** continuous current draw.

### 5.2 Adding a Safety Margin

To ensure reliability and prevent overheating, it's prudent to include a safety margin—commonly **20%**.

$$
I_{\text{ESC, min}} = 49.5 \,\text{A} \times 1.2 \approx 59.4 \,\text{A}
$$

**Recommendation**:
- **Minimum ESC Rating**: **60 A**.
- **Preferred Range**: **60–80 A** for additional robustness, especially under high-load conditions.

### 5.3 Battery C-Rating and Capacity

**C-Rating** indicates the maximum continuous current a battery can safely deliver:

$$
I_{\text{max}}(\text{battery}) = \text{C-rating} \times \text{Battery Capacity (Ah)}
$$

#### 5.3.1 Calculating Required C-Rating

For a 4000 mAh (4.0 Ah) battery and a ~50 A draw:

$$
\text{C-rating} \ge \frac{50 \,\text{A}}{4.0 \,\text{Ah}} = 12.5\,C
$$

**Recommendation**: **25C** or higher for added safety and reduced thermal stress.

#### 5.3.2 Example with Smaller Capacity

For a 2200 mAh (2.2 Ah) battery:

$$
\text{C-rating} \ge \frac{50 \,\text{A}}{2.2 \,\text{Ah}} \approx 22.7\,C
$$

**Implications**:
- **Feasibility**: Achievable with 25C or 35C packs.
- **Trade-offs**: Shorter flight times and increased thermal stress.
- **Recommendation**: Prefer higher capacity (≥4000 mAh) for trainer-sized aircraft to balance performance and safety.

## 6. Determining Motor RPM and kV

Selecting a motor with the appropriate RPM characteristics ensures compatibility with the battery voltage and propeller selection.

### 6.1 Target RPM (No-Load)

The **No-Load RPM** is the motor's rotational speed without any load (propeller attached). For this example:

- **Desired No-Load RPM**: Approximately **10,740 RPM**.

**Considerations**:
- Derived from aerodynamic calculations and empirical data for similar trainer aircraft.
- Acts as a reference point for matching motor and propeller specifications.

### 6.2 Calculating kV

**kV Rating** denotes the motor's RPM per volt applied:

$$
k_V = \frac{\text{Target RPM}}{\text{Nominal Voltage}} = \frac{10{,}740 \,\text{RPM}}{22.2 \,\text{V}} \approx 484 \,\text{RPM/V}
$$

**Interpretation**:
- A motor with a **kV** around **480–500 RPM/V** is suitable.
- Actual motors are typically available in standard kV increments (e.g., 480 kV, 500 kV, 520 kV).

**Note**: Variations in battery voltage (from fully charged to nearly depleted) will affect in-flight RPM. For example:
- **Fully Charged 6S LiPo (25.2 V)**: 
  $$ 
  k_V \times V = 484 \,\text{RPM/V} \times 25.2 \,\text{V} \approx 12{,}196 \,\text{RPM} 
  $$
- **Nearly Depleted 6S LiPo (19.8 V)**:
  $$
  484 \,\text{RPM/V} \times 19.8 \,\text{V} \approx 9{,}583 \,\text{RPM}
  $$

### 6.3 Verifying Motor Specifications

Ensure the selected motor meets the following criteria:

1. **Voltage Rating**:
   - Must be compatible with 6S LiPo (22.2 V nominal, up to 25.2 V fully charged).
   - Often denoted as “2–6S” or “up to 22.2 V” in specifications.

2. **Current Handling**:
   - **Continuous Current**: Approximately **50–60 A**.
   - Check manufacturer datasheets for recommended continuous current limits.

3. **Power Rating**:
   - **Continuous Power**: ≥ **1100 W**.
   - Differentiate between continuous and burst (peak) power ratings; rely on continuous ratings to prevent overheating.

4. **Efficiency**:
   - Higher efficiency motors reduce battery drain and heat generation.

5. **Durability**:
   - Robust construction to withstand the stresses of flight maneuvers.

## 7. Selecting an Initial Propeller

The propeller is integral to translating motor power into thrust. Selecting the right propeller involves balancing diameter and pitch to match motor capabilities and desired performance.

### 7.1 Propeller Dimensions

**Propeller Size Notation**: **Diameter × Pitch** (e.g., 14 × 9).

- **Diameter (in inches)**: Measures the length from tip to tip.
- **Pitch (in inches)**: The theoretical distance the propeller would move in one rotation without slippage.

**Impact of Dimensions**:

1. **Diameter**:
   - **Larger Diameter**: Increases static thrust by moving more air.
   - **Smaller Diameter**: Reduces load on the motor, allowing higher RPMs.

2. **Pitch**:
   - **Higher Pitch**: Increases potential airspeed but raises current draw at higher RPMs.
   - **Lower Pitch**: Decreases airspeed potential but reduces current draw.

**Initial Selection for Example**: **14 × 9** propeller.

**Rationale**: A conservative starting point that balances thrust and motor load, allowing for safe testing and adjustments based on performance data.

### 7.2 Adjusting the Propeller

Post-initial testing, adjustments may be necessary based on real-world performance metrics.

- **If Current is Too High or Components Overheat**:
  - **Reduce Diameter**: e.g., move from 14 × 9 to 13 × 9.
  - **Reduce Pitch**: e.g., move from 14 × 9 to 14 × 8.

- **If Performance is Insufficient**:
  - **Increase Diameter**: e.g., move from 14 × 9 to 15 × 9.
  - **Increase Pitch**: e.g., move from 14 × 9 to 14 × 10.

**Recommendation**: Make incremental changes and monitor the effects on current draw, temperature, and flight performance to find the optimal propeller size.
