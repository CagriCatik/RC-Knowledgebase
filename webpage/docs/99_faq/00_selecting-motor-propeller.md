# Selecting Motor and Propeller

Selecting the right combination of motor and propeller is pivotal for achieving optimal performance, efficiency, and reliability in your fixed-wing RC (Radio-Controlled) airplane. This chapter delves into essential considerations, rules of thumb, and practical tips to guide both beginners and seasoned hobbyists in making informed decisions when pairing motors with propellers for their fixed-wing models.

## Overview

Fixed-wing RC airplanes rely on the synergy between the motor and propeller to generate thrust, control speed, and ensure stable flight characteristics. Unlike multi-rotor setups, fixed-wing models require careful calibration of thrust-to-weight ratios, propeller sizing, and motor specifications to meet the desired flight performance, whether it be for leisurely gliding, competitive racing, or intricate aerobatics.

## Understanding the Basics

### Motor and Propeller Synergy

- **Motor:** Provides the necessary rotational force (torque) to spin the propeller, converting electrical energy from the battery into mechanical energy.
- **Propeller:** Converts the rotational energy from the motor into thrust, propelling the airplane forward.

The interaction between the motor's power output and the propeller's size and pitch determines the airplane's speed, acceleration, and overall performance.

### Key Parameters

- **KV Rating:** Indicates the motor's RPM per volt. A higher KV means the motor spins faster at a given voltage.
- **Thrust:** The force generated by the propeller, measured in grams or ounces.
- **Watts per Pound (W/lb):** A scale that helps determine the appropriate power level based on the airplane's weight.
- **Propeller Diameter and Pitch:** Diameter affects thrust and efficiency, while pitch influences speed and torque.

## Step 1: Determining the Desired Performance Level

### Performance Categories

1. **Gliders:** Emphasize efficiency and prolonged flight times with minimal thrust.
2. **General Aviation:** Balanced performance suitable for a variety of maneuvers and stable flight.
3. **Sport/Pattern Flying:** Higher thrust for aerobatics and dynamic maneuvers.
4. **3D Performance:** Maximum thrust for intricate aerobatics and hovering capabilities.

### Watts per Pound Scale

The Watts per Pound (W/lb) scale serves as a guideline to match the motor's power output with the airplane's weight and intended performance:

- **Gliders:** 50–60 W/lb
- **General Aviation:** 85–100 W/lb
- **Sport/Pattern Flying:** 100–120 W/lb
- **3D Performance:** 150+ W/lb

**Example Calculation:**

For a general aviation model weighing 1 lb (approximately 500 grams):

$$
\text{Required Wattage} = 1 \, \text{lb} \times 100 \, \text{W/lb} = 100 \, \text{W}
$$

## Step 2: Selecting the Motor

### Key Specifications

1. **Power Rating (Watts):** Should align with the calculated requirement from the W/lb scale.
2. **KV Rating:** Determines the motor's speed. Lower KV for larger props and higher efficiency; higher KV for smaller props and greater speed.
3. **Current Draw (Amps):** Ensure compatibility with the ESC and battery.
4. **Physical Dimensions:** Must fit within the airplane's motor mount and consider propeller clearance.

### Example Selection

For a 1 lb general aviation model requiring 100 W:

- **Motor KV:** Approximately 100 KV per volt (e.g., 1000 KV for a 10 V system).
- **Power Rating:** At least 100 W.
- **Current Draw:** Should be within the ESC and battery's capacity.

## Step 3: Selecting the Propeller

### Understanding Diameter and Pitch

- **Diameter (in inches):** Larger diameter props are generally more efficient, producing more thrust at lower RPMs.
- **Pitch (in inches):** Represents the theoretical distance the propeller would move forward in one revolution. Higher pitch increases speed but requires more power.

### Rules of Thumb

1. **Use the Largest Propeller Possible:** Larger props are more efficient, providing greater thrust with less power consumption.
2. **Balance Diameter and Pitch:** Ensure that both parameters complement the motor's capabilities and the airplane's performance requirements.
3. **Manufacturer Recommendations:** Refer to motor manufacturers' propeller charts for compatibility and optimal performance.

### Propeller Efficiency

Larger propellers spinning at lower speeds tend to be more efficient than smaller props spinning faster. This efficiency translates to better thrust generation without excessive power draw, enhancing flight time and reducing battery consumption.

### Example Selection

For a 100 W motor:

- **Suggested Propeller:** 14x9 inches
  - **Diameter:** 14 inches
  - **Pitch:** 9 inches

This propeller size provides a balance between thrust and efficiency for general aviation purposes.

## Step 4: Thrust-to-Weight Ratio

### Calculating Thrust Requirements

Thrust-to-weight ratio is crucial in determining how much thrust your airplane needs to achieve desired performance.

$$
\text{Thrust-to-Weight Ratio} = \frac{\text{Thrust (g)}}{\text{Weight (g)}}
$$

### Guidelines

- **Gliders:** Minimum thrust-to-weight ratio of 0.5 (i.e., thrust = 500 g for a 1 kg model).
- **General Aviation:** Approximately 1:1 (i.e., thrust = weight).
- **Sport/Pattern Flying:** 1.2–1.5:1 (i.e., 1200–1500 g thrust for a 1 kg model).
- **3D Performance:** 1.5–2:1 or higher (i.e., 1500–2000 g thrust for a 1 kg model).

**Example:**

For a 1 kg general aviation model:

$$
\text{Required Thrust} = 1 \, \text{kg} \times 1000 \, \text{g/kg} = 1000 \, \text{g}
$$

## Step 5: ESC (Electronic Speed Controller) Selection

### Importance of ESC

The ESC regulates the power supplied to the motor, controlling speed and direction. Selecting an ESC with appropriate current handling capabilities ensures reliable performance and protects against overheating or failure.

### Key Considerations

1. **Current Rating:** Should exceed the maximum current draw of the motor.
2. **Battery Compatibility:** Ensure the ESC can handle the voltage of the chosen battery (e.g., 3S, 4S).
3. **Features:** Consider programmable settings, brake functions, and throttle response customization.

### Safety Margin

It's advisable to select an ESC with a current rating at least 20–30% higher than the motor's maximum current draw to provide a safety margin and enhance durability.

**Example:**

For a motor that draws 10 A at maximum throttle:

$$
\text{Recommended ESC Rating} = 10 \, \text{A} \times 1.2 = 12 \, \text{A}
$$

Choose an ESC rated for **15 A** to ensure reliable operation.
