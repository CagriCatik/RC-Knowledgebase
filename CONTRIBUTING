# CONTRIBUTING TO THIS MESS

Wow, you actually want to contribute? That’s... bold. Welcome to the absurd chaos of this project. If you're still reading, here are the “guidelines” (read: vague suggestions) to not make everything worse.

## REPORTING ISSUES

Think you found a bug? Or just confused by your own code? Either way, open an issue. Use the fancy `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE` things like a civilized human. Please include:

- What broke (duh)
- How to make it break again
- What you *thought* it would do
- What it *actually* did, besides disappointing you

## PULL REQUESTS

PRs are a thing. You can make one. Here’s how to not make it painful:

1. Fork this dumpster fire and branch off `main`.
2. Make your changes. Try not to reinvent disaster.
3. Commit like you mean it. No “Update file” nonsense.
4. Open a PR. Describe what changed and *why you thought it was a good idea*.
5. Reference issues, or just pretend you're fixing world peace.

## CODING STANDARDS (LOL)

We pretend to have standards. Please humor us by:

- Writing code that someone, someday, might understand
- Commenting the WTFs and WHYs
- Writing tests, unless it’s too hard (but seriously, write tests)

## LICENSE OF CONTRIBUTIONS

By pushing code here, you consent to it becoming part of this mess. It inherits the project’s license (which basically means we can do WTF WE WANT with it too). Thanks!

Pull requests may be ignored, mocked, or accepted with no explanation. Good luck.
