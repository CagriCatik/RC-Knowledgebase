# ✈️ RC Engineering Hub 🚗  
_The Encyclopedia of Glorious Overengineering_

Welcome to the **RC Engineering Hub**, where adulting means spending 40 hours perfecting the aerodynamics of a plastic plane while ignoring the dishes. This is your one-stop-shop for over-detailed, underused knowledge about remote-controlled planes, cars, and 3D-printed parts you’ll definitely never finish printing.

## 🛫 Getting Started

Never touched an RC car but still think you’re smarter than gravity? Perfect. We’ve got enough tutorials to keep you pretending you're being productive for weeks.

---

## ✈️ RC Plane Guides

Soar through the sky like a majestic brick.  
Includes:
- Detailed instructions on how to crash gracefully.
- Diagrams you’ll ignore.
- Aerodynamics for people who hated physics in school but suddenly care deeply.

---

## 🏎️ RC Car Guides

Speed is everything. Until you flip it, burn the ESC, and cry.  
Inside:
- Tuning tips you’ll misinterpret.
- Maintenance routines no one follows.
- Racing techniques that might work (on paper).

**Product Comparisons**  
Because you need 3 spreadsheets to decide which battery lasts 3 more seconds.

---

## 🖨️ 3D Printing

Nothing says “fun” like a 17-hour print that fails at 99%.  
Topics include:
- STL files that _almost_ fit.
- Printer maintenance (LOL).
- Component compatibility, assuming your sanity lasts that long.
