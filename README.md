# ✈️ RC Engineering Hub 🚗  
_The Encyclopedia of Glorious Overengineering_

Welcome to the **RC Engineering Hub**, where adulting means spending 40 hours perfecting the aerodynamics of a 3D printed plane while ignoring the dishes. This is your one-stop-shop for over-detailed, underused knowledge about remote-controlled planes, cars, and 3D-printed parts you’ll definitely never finish printing.

Clearly, you have too much money and not enough supervision.

> 🛠️ This fucking awesome [entire site](https://cagricatik.github.io/RC-Knowledgebase/) is built with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/)
>

> Because nothing screams “cutting-edge RC engineering” like Markdown files duct-taped together by a dinosaur-themed static site generator.

## 🛫 Getting Started

Never touched an RC car but still think you’re smarter than gravity? Perfect. I’ve got enough tutorials to keep you pretending you're being productive for weeks 📚🛠️.

---

## ✈️ RC Plane Guides

Soar through the sky like a majestic brick 🧱✈️  
Includes:

- Detailed instructions on how to crash gracefully 💥.  
- Diagrams you’ll ignore 📝.  
- Aerodynamics for people who hated physics in school but suddenly care deeply 🧪.

---

## 🚁 RC Drone Guides

Fly like a pro. Or like a $400 firework 🎆🚁  
Includes:

- How to recalibrate your IMU after smacking a wall 🧱.  
- Wiring nightmares made simple (not really) 🔌😵.  
- GPS lock… eventually 🛰️⌛.

## 🏎️ RC Car Guides

Speed is everything. Until you flip it, burn the ESC, and cry 🔥😢  
Inside:

- Tuning tips you’ll misinterpret 🔧.  
- Maintenance routines no one follows 🧽.  
- Racing techniques that might work (on paper) 🏁.

**Product Comparisons**  
Because you need 3 spreadsheets to decide which battery lasts 3 more seconds 📊🔋.

---

## 🎮 RC Controller Guides

The only time you'll read a manual 📖🎮  
Inside:

- Button maps for games you'll never finish 🎯.  
- Range tests done in urban hellscapes 🏙️📶.  
- UI workflows with the elegance of a fax machine 🖨️🧩.

**Product Comparisons**  
Because every controller is "the best" according to someone on Reddit 🧠💬.

---

## 🧠 Flight Controller

Because you definitely want a crash to be the computer's fault 🖥️✈️💀  
Inside:

- Firmware options that require a PhD in YouTube 🎓📺.  
- PID tuning for the brave 🧪⚙️.  
- Logs you’ll never read 📂🙈.

**Product Comparisons**  
Because your flight controller needs more features than a smartphone 📱🤖.

---

## 🕹️ Simulators

Practice crashing in a digital environment before doing it for real 💻🔥  
Inside:

- Physics engines that make Mario Kart look realistic 🏎️💫.  
- USB joystick setup rage 🎮😤.  
- Training modes that just mock your reflexes 👀👎.

**Product Comparisons**  
Because spending money on fake RC is now normal 💸🧩.

## 🖨️ 3D Printing

Nothing says “fun” like a 17-hour print that fails at 99% 🫠🕒  
Topics include:

- STL files that _almost_ fit 🧷.  
- Printer maintenance (LOL) 🧼❌.  
- Component compatibility, assuming your sanity lasts that long 🧠🔩.
