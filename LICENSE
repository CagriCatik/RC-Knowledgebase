                Version 3.666 - The Eternal Shrug Edition

Copyright (C) [year] [author]

Everyone is permitted to copy, modify, merge, sell, fork, publish,
sublicense, or ritualistically sacrifice this software and associated
files (the “Software”), under the following conditions:

1. Do WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT with this Software.

2. The Software is provided “AS IS”, without warranty of any kind,
   express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties
   of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and noninfringement.
   If it explodes, implodes, or erases your hard drive, that’s a you problem.

3. In no event shall the authors, maintainers, contributors, past selves,
   future reincarnations, or any other sentient or non-sentient entities
   be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability. You assumed the risk
   the moment you cloned this repository.

4. You do not need to credit the author. In fact, pretend it’s yours.
   Give a TED Talk about it. Put it on your résumé. We’ll never know.

5. Redistribution of this license is allowed under the same license
   (a.k.a. go ahead, copy this nonsense into your own repo).

6. Contributions are welcome, but don’t expect praise, feedback,
   or sanity.

TL;DR:
  Take it.
  Use it.
  Break it.
  Blame someone else.

If legal systems collapse tomorrow, this license will survive in a meme.

                WTFYWPL – Because legalese is for cowards.
